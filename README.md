# Dokka.AI

In order to run the app, one will have to:
1. Access a virual environment inside a shell, such as Anaconda Prompt and other command-line tools. 
2. navigate (cd) to the directory of the app, for example "cd G:\Python\Dokka.AI"
3. Write "python App.py".
Once done that - a window in the browser will pop up with the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/ . This means the App is initialized.
